## Factor the shared IOCP/RIO data path

**Status:** proposed, not started.

`IocpShard` and `WindowsRioShard` have evolved in parallel and are now largely the same code. Measured
2026-07-26: normalise the two type names and **646 lines are byte-identical** (~57% of the RIO file,
which is 1126 lines to IOCP's 1263); 38 methods share a name across both. Some are already
character-for-character identical (`QueueCipher`, `SendEncrypted`, `FireTlsOpen`, `DriveTlsHandshake`,
`StartPendingSend`).

The genuine differences cluster in only two places:

- the I/O primitive — `WSASend`/`WSARecv` + per-op `OVERLAPPED` vs `RIOSend`/`RIOReceive` + request
  queue, completion queue, and deferred-commit batching;
- teardown bookkeeping — RIO additionally carries `Rq`, `CommitPending`, `CommitRecv`, `CommitSend`.

**Why it matters:** every feature is currently written twice. TLS interception was (2026-07-25), and an
epoll backend (below) would make it a third copy of the send machinery. That is the argument — not
tidiness.

**Shape:** a shared `WindowsShardBase<TConn>` owning slot lifecycle (`InitClient`/`FreeSlot`/
`CloseClient`/`TryFinalize`), cross-thread marshalling (`EnqueueInbound`/`SubmitClose`/`SubmitFlush`/
`DrainCrossThread`/`Poke`), listen + connect (`Listen`/`ListenHandle`/`Connect`/`StartConnect`/
`CreateListener`/`StartAccept`/`PostAccept`/`HandleAccept`), the send state machine (`Pending`,
`StageOutbound`, `StartPendingSend`, `CompleteWrite`, `SubmitSendBuffer`, `FailSend`, `HandleSend`), the
whole TLS block, and adoption (`AdoptAccepted`/`HandleConnect`). Each backend keeps only: arm-a-receive,
issue-a-send, the completion pump (`OnRun`), its setup/teardown, and RIO's commit-batching hook.

Half the pattern already exists: `WindowsOutboundConnection` is the shared base for the connection
types, and `IocpConnection`/`RioConnection` already declare identical `Socket`/`Generation`/`Closing`/
`RecvArmed`/`RecvBuf`/`SendBusy`/`SendBuf`/`SendSent`/`SendTotal`/`Pending`/`IsClient` fields. Those move
down; `SkipOnSuccess` stays on IOCP, `Rq`/`Commit*` on RIO.

**Decide up front:**

1. *Dispatch cost.* A plain abstract base puts a virtual call on `IssueSend`/`ArmRecv` — per operation,
   on the hottest path. Prefer a generic-struct ops parameter (`where TOps : struct, IShardOps`) so the
   JIT devirtualises.
2. *Test story.* No unit tests; this is the hottest code in the repo. The smoke matrix is now good enough
   to be a before/after gate — `--verify-echo`, `--verify`, `--churn`, `--poke`, plaintext and TLS — but
   it must be run across all three Windows backends on both sides of the change.

## epoll backend for Linux

**Status:** proposed, not started. Sequence **after** the IOCP/RIO factoring, so it lands on a shared
base rather than adding a fourth copy of the send machinery.

**Not for throughput.** Linux already falls back to `SocketSetFactory.Managed`, and .NET's managed socket
async path *is* epoll (`SocketAsyncEngine`). So this is not "add epoll", it is "replace .NET's epoll
engine with our own" — unlikely to win much on syscall efficiency, and it will never beat io_uring where
io_uring is available.

**The actual argument — threading-model uniformity.** `ManagedSocketShard` reports
`UsesWorkerThreads = false`: no loop thread, completions land on arbitrary thread-pool threads. That is
why it alone needs `conn.TlsGate`, a coarse per-connection lock held across encrypt→enqueue, and why it
cannot share shard-wide scratch the way io_uring/IOCP/RIO do. A native epoll backend with the
single-owner loop-thread model collapses that special case: one shape for all backends, no gate, features
written once.

**And the fallback matters more than it looks.** Discovered 2026-07-25: Docker's default seccomp profile
blocks io_uring outright, so a containerised Linux deployment silently lands on the managed backend
(confirmed — the container reports `ManagedSocketFactory` unless `--privileged`). GKE and others disable
it too. "Linux means io_uring" is not safe to assume, which makes the weakest backend the one that often
runs in production.

**Cost, honestly:** epoll is *readiness*, not completion — a different model from the other three. Needs a
readiness→completion adapter (on `EPOLLIN`, non-blocking `recv` into a pooled buffer and synthesise the
completion the shard API expects; on `EPOLLOUT`, drain the write queue), with `EAGAIN`/partial-write
handling moving into the loop and per-connection writable-interest registration (arm/disarm `EPOLLOUT`)
that no other backend needs. That last part is the usually-underestimated bit.

**Do first:** measure io_uring vs epoll vs managed with `--latency` and `--bandwidth`. If they land within
a few percent, the performance case is dead and the decision is purely architectural. This IS measurable
under Docker with `--security-opt seccomp=unconfined` (see below), though a loopback container shares all
the caveats in `AspNetDemo/RESULTS.md`.

**Status: DONE (2026-07-26).** `src/SocketSet/Epoll`, with TLS. Passes the smoke matrix - echo, byte-exact
verify, out-of-band send, poke, churn, AF_UNIX, ALPN. Measured at parity with io_uring and stock Kestrel
on small-message plaintext (102.5k vs 105.2k vs 102.8k rps, ~3% spread). What remains is the measurement
below, on real hardware.

## Performance follow-ups (from the 2026-07-26 Linux size sweep)

Goodput MiB/s, median of 3 scored passes, Docker/loopback (`bench/run-tls-sizes.sh`):

| payload | iouring | epoll+tls | iouring+tls | iouring+ktls | kestrel+tls |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 512 B | 94.9 | 70.3 | 69.4 | 74.8 | 65.2 |
| 16 KB | 2,401 | 1,602 | 1,395 | 1,350 | 1,673 |
| 256 KB | 4,379 | 2,814 | **1,183** | 1,951 | **8,383** |

Unlike the small-message numbers these repeat tightly (~1-10% between passes), so the large-payload
shape is worth acting on.

### 1. io_uring+TLS large-payload behaviour — INVESTIGATED 2026-07-26, NOT CONFIRMED

**Status: could not reproduce in a container. Do not treat the regression below as established.**

What was checked, so it is not repeated:

- *Pool-exhaustion hypothesis: REFUTED.* `TlsSend` copies ciphertext into `WritePageSize` (4KB) chunks
  leased from the out-of-band pool, falling back to a PINNED GC allocation per chunk when dry. One 256KB
  response needs 64 chunks against a 256-chunk-per-shard pool, so exhaustion looked likely. Measured with
  `SS_URING_STATS=1` across 512B-256KB x 8-64 connections: **0.0% miss in every combination.** Pages are
  released as sends complete; the pool is never the constraint. A tidy story, and wrong.
- *Throughput: did not reproduce.* A pure-transport comparison (SmokeTest, no Kestrel bridge) gave
  contradictory results run to run at 8 connections, and at 64 connections every backend converged on
  ~6.5 GB/s - a shared ceiling, so the test was bounded by the host rather than the transport. The
  original 16KB->256KB decline came from the ASP.NET sweep, where the bridge is also in the path (item 3).

**What remains, and is real regardless of timing:** io_uring copies EVERY ciphertext byte into 4KB chunks
and dispatches a writev of N segments (~1.6M chunk-copies/sec at load), where epoll sends directly from
the TLS output buffer with zero copies. That is a genuine structural difference in the send path. Whether
it costs measurable throughput needs a host that is not saturating elsewhere - i.e. real hardware.

Worth knowing before optimising it: the copy exists for a reason. `conn.TlsOut` is a reusable
`PooledBufferWriter`, so its buffer cannot be handed to an in-flight io_uring send. `PooledBufferWriter`
already has `TakeArray()` for exactly this hand-off pattern; the obstacle is that io_uring needs a stable
(pinned) address for the duration, and ArrayPool arrays are not pinned.

### ~~1b. Original observation (superseded by the above)~~

1,395 -> 1,183 MiB/s while every other leg rises. Goodput falling as payload grows is a defect signature,
not a tuning problem. Prime suspect is the outbound path: `OutChain`/writev plus write-page chunking
interacting badly with 16KB TLS records. Note io_uring+TLS is also the *slowest* leg at 256KB, below both
epoll+TLS (2.4x) and kTLS (1.6x) - it should not be.

Method that worked for the last io_uring bug: `SS_URING_TRACE=1` to see completions (failures are a
negative `cqe.res`, never a syscall error), and bisect against a minimal raw probe before blaming the
kernel or the environment.

**Highest expected value of anything on this list.**

### 2. Re-run the size sweep now the plaintext controls are in

The first sweep had one plaintext control and it was the wrong one, so nothing at >=16KB is fully
interpretable yet. Plaintext `kestrel` and `epoll` legs added 2026-07-26; just needs a run.

### 3. The AspNetDemo bridge is the bottleneck at large payloads

kestrel+tls hit 8,383 MiB/s against plaintext io_uring's 4,379 - a TLS leg beating a plaintext leg 2:1,
which is only possible because they are limited by different things. The SocketSet legs go through the
demo's Kestrel bridge (two `Pipe`s plus a copy per write in `SocketSetConnection`), and at large payloads
that bridge, not the transport or the cipher, is what is being measured.

If plaintext kestrel also lands near 8 GB/s, the bridge is costing 2-4x on big responses - which matters
more to the "ASP.NET Core over SocketSet" story than any transport difference measured so far.

### 4. kTLS: implement the RECVMSG + cmsg receive arm

Only worth doing if kTLS matters. The current kTLS path drives receive as io_uring `POLL` + `SSL_read`,
one syscall per message, forfeiting multishot receive and provided buffers - the design seam described in
`TlsFilter`'s notes (`RECVMSG` + `TLS_GET_RECORD_TYPE` cmsg) is what would let it keep them. kTLS does
already pull ahead of userspace io_uring TLS at 256KB (+65%), so the crossover is real; this is what
would make it competitive rather than merely present.

Note loopback has no NIC, so kTLS's largest win - inline NIC offload - cannot appear in any of the
numbers above. Real hardware required before drawing conclusions about kTLS itself.

### 5. Real-hardware Linux run

The rigs are in-repo and runnable: `bench/run-matrix.sh` (transport matrix) and `bench/run-tls-sizes.sh`
(payload sweep). Everything above was measured in a container on a WSL2 kernel over loopback, which is
adequate for correctness and weak for performance.

## Smaller / previously flagged

- **`close_notify` is never emitted on teardown**, on any backend. `TlsFilter.Shutdown` is implemented by
  both providers but no shard calls it; doing so means draining a final send before `closesocket`, which
  touches the teardown state machine. Deliberately deferred (2026-07-25) rather than changing teardown
  semantics on three backends inside a wiring change.
- **Negotiated cipher suite is not reported.** The AspNetDemo A/B pins the certificate so it is not a
  variable, but there is no way to confirm two legs landed on the same suite. ~40 lines:
  `SECPKG_ATTR_CONNECTION_INFO` for SChannel, `SSL_get_cipher`/`SSL_get_version` for OpenSSL, surfaced on
  `TlsFilter`. Worth having before publishing any numbers.
- **SChannel provider is `#if NET` only.** net472 would need substitutes for `X509ChainTrustMode`,
  `X509Certificate2.MatchesHostname` and `X509CertificateLoader`. The SSPI interop itself is fine there.
- **`Connection.Close()` is abortive** and truncates a queued send. Harmless on the client-close and
  abort paths, but a server-side graceful close with a pending write (or a Redis client closing with an
  unsent command) wants a flush-then-close primitive. Pre-existing; see `AspNetDemo/README.md`.
- **RESOLVED (2026-07-26): io_uring in Docker.** Two things were tangled together here, and the earlier
  entry got the conclusion wrong.
  1. Docker's default seccomp profile blocks the io_uring syscalls, so the backend silently falls back to
     managed sockets. Fix: `--security-opt seccomp=unconfined` (`--privileged` also works but changes far
     more than seccomp, which is what made this look kernel-related). Always check which backend was
     actually selected rather than assuming.
  2. With io_uring genuinely selected, every recv failed. That was *ours*, not the kernel's: multishot
     recv was submitted with a non-zero `len`, which the kernel rejects with `-EINVAL`. Fixed. io_uring
     now passes the full smoke matrix in a container, TLS included.

  Worth carrying forward: **io_uring reports operation failures as a negative `cqe.res`, not as a syscall
  error**, so a mis-built SQE presents as a healthy submit followed by silence - `strace` shows nothing
  wrong. `SS_URING_TRACE=1` now dumps every completion, which is what found it. Bisecting against a
  60-line raw-io_uring C probe (does NOP complete? does single-shot recv? multishot? with a buffer ring?)
  is what separated "kernel cannot" from "we asked wrongly".

  The claim in commits `925db23` / `1b48f8a` that io_uring was verified in a container was still wrong at
  the time - those runs were the managed backend, because seccomp had hidden io_uring from the probe.
